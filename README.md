# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers entered by the user.

## Features ✨
- ➕ Addition of two numbers
- ➖ Subtraction of two numbers
- ✖️ Multiplication of two numbers
- ➗ Division of two numbers (no zero division handling - use responsibly!)
- 😎 Fun emoji-powered output

## How to Use 🚀
1. Run the script in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended)
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. See the results of all four operations displayed!

## Example Usage 💻
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Important Notes ⚠️
- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers
- There's no zero-division protection - entering 0 as the second number will cause an error
- The calculator performs all four operations regardless of which ones you need

## Future Improvements 🔮
- Add zero-division protection
- Let users choose which operation to perform
- Add more advanced mathematical functions
- Create a GUI version

Enjoy calculating! 😎💻🎉
